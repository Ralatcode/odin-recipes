This is my first project for The Odin Project Course,
The Task is to build a  basic recipe page with only HTML 
to put all HTML knowledge acquired so far into practice.

I used basic HTML tags with no CSS to create a recipe page for the Odin Project task, which contains the homepage and three other recipe pages. 

The recipes and images were gotten from https://www.allrecipes.com/
